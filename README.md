The Dockerfile defines the Docker image for your Node.js application, and docker-compose.yml orchestrates containers for Node.js and MongoDB.
package.json contains dependencies and scripts for your Node.js application.
server.js is the entry point of your Node.js application.
/views directory contains EJS templates for rendering HTML pages.
/public directory contains static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
/controllers directory holds controller logic for handling requests.
/models directory defines MongoDB schemas and models.
/routes directory contains route definitions for different endpoints.
Database Schema:

You'll design MongoDB schemas for storing data related to products, users, orders, etc.
For example, a Product schema might include fields like name, description, price, category, image, etc.
User schema might include fields like name, email, password, address, orders, etc.
Server-side Logic:

Implement routes and controllers to handle various functionalities like user authentication, product listing, adding items to the cart, processing orders, etc.
Use Express.js to create routes and middleware for request handling.
Implement logic to interact with MongoDB using Mongoose or native MongoDB drivers.
Frontend Design:

Design responsive UI using Bootstrap components for navigation, product listings, cart, checkout, etc.
Utilize EJS templates to generate dynamic HTML content based on data from the server.
Implement client-side validation and interaction using JavaScript/jQuery.
Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication using techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication.
Secure routes and endpoints based on user roles and permissions.
Dockerization:

Write a Dockerfile to define the container image for your Node.js application.
Use docker-compose to define and run multiple containers for Node.js and MongoDB.
Ensure proper configuration for networking and data persistence.
Testing and Deployment:

Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your application.
Deploy your Dockerized application to a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
Scalability and Performance:

Optimize your application for performance by caching, load balancing, and optimizing database queries.
Design the application with scalability in mind to handle increased traffic and load.
Remember to document your code and follow best practices for security, performance, and maintainability throughout the development process. Additionally, consider implementing features like search functionality, product reviews, and order tracking to enhance the user experience of your e-commerce website.
